# Context-Based-Meta-learning-Framework-for-Contrastive-Learning-General-Classification
We aim to increase the accuracy and robustness of contrastive learning by integrative adaptive mechanisms for positive pair selection in the SimCLR framework. By doing this, we aim to optimize the effectiveness of distance functions.
